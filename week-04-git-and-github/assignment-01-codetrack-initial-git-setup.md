# Assignment 1 — CodeTrack: Initial Git Setup (Local Only)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will set up Git correctly on your local machine before starting the CodeTrack project. You will create a local repository and configure your Git identity at both the repository level (local) and the machine level (global). This assignment is local only — you will not push anything to GitHub yet.

# Task 1 — Create the CodeTrack Project and Initialize Git

## Goal

Create a `CodeTrack` project folder and initialize it as a Git repository.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `git init` inside `CodeTrack` showing "Initialized empty Git repository"

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `ls -a` showing the `.git` folder

### Notes

**1. What is the `.git` folder, and why does it matter?**

The `.git` folder is a hidden directory created when we initialize a Git repository. It stores important information such as commit history, configuration, branches, and other data needed for version control. It allows Git to track changes in the project, maintain different versions of the code, and help us manage our work efficiently.

# Task 2 — Configure Git Identity Locally (Repository-Only)

## Goal

Set your Git username and email for the `CodeTrack` repository only, using `git config --local`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `git config --local --list` showing your `user.name` and `user.email`

<img width="477" height="216" alt="Screenshot 2026-10-11 075519" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd743c12-062d-41c1-813a-f016cd0c57f6" />


# Task 3 — Configure Git Identity Globally

## Goal

Set a global Git username and email for this machine using `git config --global`. Note that CodeTrack's local settings still take priority over these.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Output of `git config --global --list` showing your `user.name` and `user.email`

<img width="482" height="128" alt="Screenshot 2026-10-11 075758" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20715fe8-e049-422e-a037-0ebe0335ab91" />
